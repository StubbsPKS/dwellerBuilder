# Architecture Design Record: Use ADRs

## Context

We are all novice developers and would like to make it as easy as possible for us to collaborate on this project.
In order to achieve that goal: 
- We want to ensure that we consider any alternatives when making an architectrual decision (AD).
- We want to base our ADs on well-researched opinions that should be easily recalled at a later date.
- We don't want one person making an AD in a vacuum without input from the team.
- Despite being a in different geographic areas, we want our team members to have a strong shared understanding of the technical rationale behind decisions.
- We want to be able to revisit prior decisions to determine fairly if they still make sense, and if the motivating circumstances or conditions have changed.

## Consequences

1. Developers must write an ADR and submit it for review before selecting an approach to any architectural decision -- that is, any decision that affects the way the application is put together at a high level.
1. We will have a concrete artifact around which to focus discussion, before finalizing decisions.
1. If we follow the process, decisions will be made deliberately, as a group.
1. The master branch of our repositories will reflect the high-level consensus of the steering group.
1. We will have a useful persistent record of why the system is the way it is.
