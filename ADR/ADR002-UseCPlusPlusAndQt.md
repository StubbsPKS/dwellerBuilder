# Architecture Design Record: Implement in C++ With Qt

## Context
We are developing an application that helps with the creation of a character in a game for which we do not own the IP. This puts some limitations on the application. Although we have spoken to the creator of Fate of the Norns: Ragnarok and he is aware that we are creating a dweller builder, we plan to build this project with IP protection in mind from the start.

The limitations we think should be placed on the application are:
- We will need to be able to distribute the dweller builder seperate from the data files as the data files will contain IP.
- We will need to be as transparent as possible in the process to facilitate the IP holder reviewing the application and how it works should he want to.
- We do not want the user to be required to run database software.
- We do not want to have to pay for hosting.
