# Architecture Design Record: Use the C++ Standard Template Library (STL)

## Context
The [Standard Template Library (STL)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-c-standard-template-library-stl/) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of container classes, algorithms and iterators. It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized. A working knowledge of template classes is a prerequisite for working with STL.

Using the STL as a wrapper for common functionality will greatly speed up our ability to create this application.
