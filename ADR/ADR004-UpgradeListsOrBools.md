# Architecture Design Record: Define How Characters Upgrades Are Stored

## Context
In the process of designing our ```Characters``` class, we have come across a decision of how to store the upgrades.

We have two choices:
1. We can use a list of custom type ```Upgrades``` and create an ```Upgrades``` class.
1. We can use a ```bool``` for each upgrade.
